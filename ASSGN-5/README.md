# WEB322FINAL

Im very sorry prof, I was not able to complete the assignment as required, I tried to follow as best as I could with the videos but was not able to make it work as well as I would have liked to. I have had all 4 of my exams and the web quiz yesterday and today, and just got swamped and have to go to work right now as well. Im really sorry I tried as best as I could. Thank you though for being a really good prof that took us through the steps and explained anything we needed, probably the best professor ive had at seneca, so thank you for that and again sorry about the incomplete assignment.
