STEPS FOR THE APPLICATION

This application allows to go to multiple routes
whether that is /list , or /details/(idnumber) where id number is that actual id number of a user OR a product with /productlist and /productdetails/(idnumber) from the fakeuser or fakeproducts.json
You will now see a table with the list of users , and the json output of the products from the above routes
For the api routes, just add /api/users after the localhost:8080 to get access to all the users info, or a specific one using thier ID /api/users/1 
Can do the same for products as well

Thank you for using this application. Please let me know if you have any troubles with the application. Will bugfix and update the application as soon as possible.
